Event Run by Danielle Fudger and Ryan Wilson-Perkin

##Talks given by:

* Ryan Wilson-Perkin

We had a great time tonight speaking with all of you tonight!

Attendees learned a bit about the history of computer security and encryption and how the world's idea of privacy is changing.

We also had some profs and upper year students in attendance answering questions about course selection, planning for minors, and dealing with exams.

Looking forward to seeing you all again next week!
