We've got some awesome talks lined up for this Wednesday! 4 separate talks by senior and junior students showing off their projects.

Building Multiplatform Mobile Applications with the Cordova / PhoneGap Framework
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This talk will given by Jacob Barrick And Lee-Jay Cluskey-Belanger part of their CIS49** course. Where they created two separate mobile applications using the PhoneGap API. This talk will cover the installation of the framework as well as a demo to build your first mobile app using the three main web languages HTML5, CSS and JavaScript. We will walk you through build and theme your first basic multi page application using JQueryMobile and ThemeRoller. We will also demonstrate how the framework interacts with the hardware allowing us to access such features as Geolocation, contacts, and device information.
