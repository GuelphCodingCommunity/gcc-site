We've got two great talks lined up for this week on software development and testing best practices. 

Julian Horvat
-------------
Ever wanted to create your own website but wanted to be fully in control of the creation process? Then this talk is for you. I'll be talking about how to create a site from the ground up using 100% free software, all you need is a Github account. No server required!

Erica Pisani
------------
Wondering why you got a 0 on your latest programming assignment? Was it because something that you thought was working didn't actually work? Learn the mysterious ways of unit testing, which will save your ass in most programming related problems.

Looking forward to seeing you all there!
