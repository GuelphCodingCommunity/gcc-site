GCC will be holding its next event this Wednesday (Nov. 6th). This event will be run by Exec. Jonathan Snowdon and he will also be doing a talk on "Tips to Technical Interviews". There will also be a guest speaker coming to introduce another club that may be needing GCC's help. Finally there may be time for another talk but that is still in the works for now. And we will update on that as soon as we know for certain. 

We look forward to having everyone come out and join us, and hopefully learn some cool tips to get your next job!

See you soon,

GCC
