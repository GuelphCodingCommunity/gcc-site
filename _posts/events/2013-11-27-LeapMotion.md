Leap Into Motion with Oliver Cook! + Intro to Javascript and the HTML canvas with Alex Pennells!
Where: Reynolds 114
When: Wednesday November 27th, 2013
For this weekâ€™s gcc presentation Oliver will be demonstrating the capabilities and limitations of the Leap Motion device as well as outlining its basic API structure and development process. This will include interactive demonstrations of the finger and hand tracking, 3d space navigation and gesture recognition capabilities followed by a brief explanation of how each works. A High level explanation of the API will be given along with some technical programming examples of each of the features. Oliver will also be covering some potential real world applications including OS control, video games and medical rehabilitation. Some of the issues and limitations that he has encountered throughout development will also be covered.
The second talk will be held by Alex Pennells and will be talking about how to create some neat projects with Javascript and HTML (more details to come).
