Ever wanted to learn Objective-C & app development for iDevices but not sure where to begin? Come out to the another GCC event on Wednesday November 20, from 7pm to 9pm in Reynolds 114, where we will discuss some of the basics of app development for iDevices and teach you how to get started building your own app. The speaker for this event will be Corey Alexander.

We look forward to having everyone come out and join us, and hopefully get started on your first iOS app.

See you soon,

GCC
