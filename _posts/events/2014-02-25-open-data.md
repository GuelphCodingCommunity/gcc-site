Hopefully everyone is thoroughly enjoying their Winter Semester and looking forward to some kickass GCC events.

We'll be starting with some demonstrations by the winners of the Guelph Open Data hackathon over the weekend. First place took $2500 with an iOS app, and all the winners were from the University.

We'll have presentations by all three winners showing off what they built in a 24hr timespan and teaching you about the technologies they used (bootstrap, RESTful APIs, iOS, jQueryUI) so don't miss it.

If we have enough time we'll also have a brief demonstration on how to customize the hell out of your terminal to get an experience like you see 'hackers' using in the movies :)
