This week we'd like to have a workshop that gets everyone involved in giving back to the community. In addition to a talk on security and privacy, we'll have an opportunity for everyone to ask general coding questions and prepare for their upcoming finals.

###Privacy and Security

All good coders know the value of strong security and the right to privacy. Sadly security is impossible to get perfect and social networks make people less concerned about their rights to privacy.

This week we'll be tackling the idea of creating secure systems and keeping black hat hackers out.

###Finals Preparation

The main focus of the GCC is bringing coders together as a community. This will be a trial in working with one another to be better prepared for the upcoming final exams.

We will have a session that involves upper year students (and hopefully some profs!) giving advice on how to study better, and sharing their past mistakes.
