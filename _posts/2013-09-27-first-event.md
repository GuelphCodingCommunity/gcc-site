Your execs have been working very hard over the summer and we're happy to finally bring you the first installment of the GCC workshops. We'll have two execs leading talks for this event and a round of lightning talks at the end for anyone who wants to show off something they're passionate about. Send us an email if you're interested in giving a talk, and we'll see you all very soon!

###Building with Bootstrap

*with Ryan Wilson-Perkin*

This workshop will help you create your first mobile responsive website. You're going to use LESS, Javascript, and the Bootstrap framework to make a fast, beautiful website that you can use to show off your portfolio. You will need a laptop. If you cannot bring a laptop, a computer may be available for you to work on.

###Google-Fu

*with Danielle Fudger*

In this talk, Dani will be teaching you how to use your Google-Fu to become a search engine master. Her talk will include hidden features to improve your results and how to find the right resources for your coding assignments. You may want a laptop in order to try the search patterns you learn.
